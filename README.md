This project aims to demonstrate predictive modeling using machine learning techniques on a dataset. 

Datasets: Boston Marathon Dataset

Dataset Link: [2024 Boston Marathon Weather and Splits](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/runningwithrock/2024-boston-marathon-weather-and-splits )

Objective: Predict the age of an athlete based on the first and second half marathon splits.

This repository contains the implementation of a predictive model for the Boston Marathon Dataset. The model predicts the age of an athlete based on their first and second half marathon splits.

Contents
Jupyter Notebook: Untitled.ipynb

This notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.

Data: Athletes.csv

The dataset used for training and testing the model.

Clone the repository to your local machine:

Copy code on Git Bash:
git clone https://github.com//jahnavithutta129/AIHub-ML.git

Open and run the Jupyter Notebook (Boston_Marathon_Prediction.ipynb) using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.

Follow the instructions within the notebook to execute the code cells for data loading, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and prediction.
